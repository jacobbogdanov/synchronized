# Synchronized

a go generics synchronization library.

This package is inspired by [folly::Synchronized](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/Synchronized.md), but has almost zero of the same API.

## Usage

### Setup

At the time of writing this, the [Type Parameters Design-Draft](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md) has been [accepted](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43651),
but not released in an official version of go. To use the code in this repo you
will need to follow the instructions in the [dev.go2go README](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md).
